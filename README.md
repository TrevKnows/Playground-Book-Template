# Swift-Playground-Book-For-Bluefruit-Template
I've created an empty playground book with an Always-On Live view and a debug log setup (You can delete the debug log if you wish). Instead of creating a playground book from scratch,Â I'd recommend downloading the template playground book that we provide.

You can download the blank playground book template here.
